# Palygon

Palygon is a tamagotchi style virtual pet device.

## Developement

Development is currently in very early stages, with most hardware designed but not manufactured, and the engine in its early stages ([PAL Engine](https://github.com/benthacher/pal-engine)). Once the engine is more fleshed out, I'll pull it into this repo and start the firmware development.

## Design

The current design of Palygon will be a hexagonal housing, square 128x128 touch screen, two side buttons, and two bumper/trigger style buttons. It'll also have a 6DoF IMU just in case I want to add anything like step tracking or extra interactive aspects.
